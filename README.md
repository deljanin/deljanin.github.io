<h2>Welcome to my Portfolio project!</h2>

<h3>You can access live version here: https://deljanin.dev</h3>

For the implementation, I used HTML, Sass, React.js, and Three.js.
The website has a 3D section and on-scroll animations.
I designed it using Figma.

To run it locally follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the latest Node.js installed. (https://nodejs.org/en)

2. Make sure you have git installed. (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

3. Execute the following in a shell that can use git and node:
   `git clone https://github.com/deljanin/deljanin.github.io.git && cd deljanin.github.io && npm install && npm audit fix && npm run dev`
